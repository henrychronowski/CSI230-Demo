## 1/Start

I have never touched markdown in any significant amount before so aplogies if formatting is off

### Goal

Get basic script functionality implemented:

- check for root
- take in filename flag
- usage statement
- iterate through lines in file
- print cut usernames

## 2

All features implemented, no issues.

### Goal

Implement user creation (and deletion for sanity's sake), with the CSI230 group

- create CSI230 group if it doesn't exist
- create a user with the username given by the file
- assign a known test string password
- put newly created user in CSI230 group
- write a seperate simple script to delete all users in the CSI230 group
